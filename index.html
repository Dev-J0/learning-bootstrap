                  <p class="card-text">
                    Did you know that you can manage
                    stress and cure an illness with music?
                    In some universities in the United
                    Kingdom (UK), professors offer their
                    students the opportunity to lower
                    their stress level by listening to music
                    or learning to play an instrument.
                    It works effectively because people who
                    relax with music before or after any
                    activity feel better and they study happily.
                    All the courses start in a quiet environment. Participants listen
                    to classical or instrumental music in a quiet room. Then, a lovely voice says:
                    “Breathe, and feel the music in your heart.” After this short meditation,
                    students go to their different classes. For example, guitar, piano lessons,
                    or hip-hop. They learn about instruments and music theory. Finally,
                    students have the opportunity to compose songs and play in a band.
                    As Nietzsche said: “Without music, life is a mistake.”

                  <p class="card-text">
                    The path of a reader is not a runway but more a hack through a
                    forest, with individual twists and turns, entanglements and
                    moments of surprise. (Holden, 2004) .
                    Given the importance of reading to personal well-being and development, it is
comforting to note that it is a popular activity. A 2006 BBC survey of 4000 adults on reading habits in the
UK showed that 82% of adults enjoyed reading. Reading was rated as more
important than sex (well, for women at least) and watching TV but lagged behind
spending time with friends and family, and listening to music. A handful of studies have explored this issue, which have yielded comparable
results. For example, the Nestle Family Monitor (2003) asked 11-18 year-olds why
they read. 55% of these young people stated that books help them understand
different people/cultures, 40% wanted to learn more about new subjects, and 33%
stated that books encouraged them to try new hobbies.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Regular physical activity, fitness and exercise are critically important for the health and well-being of people of all ages. Sports boost your overall health and offer other benefits. We all know that sports are great for your physical health. But sports also have many psychological benefits.
                    Help moderate stress. About 75% to 90% of doctor visits are for stress-related illnesses. Sports help you manage stress. Exercise causes your body to release endorphins, the chemicals in your brain that relieve pain and stress. It also reduces the levels of stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline.
                    Studies have shown that 20 to 30 minutes of exercise each day can make people feel calmer. This calmness continues several hours after exercise.
                    Improve your mood. Playing a sport such as golf or skiing forces you to put aside your worries and concentrate on the task at hand. This helps you clear your mind and calm down. It also helps you sleep better.

                    <p class="lead">
                      So what's all this fuss about? Why do people travel and love travelling
                      More importantly: why should we travel more?
                      The benefits of traveling are not just a one-time thing: traveling changes you physically and psychologically.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                      1. Traveling Improves Your Health
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      From cutting down on stress, to lowering your chances of developing a heart disease, the health benefits of traveling are huge. You may stay sitting on a chair all day long at the workplace: including some walking to your trip is sure to make your body feel better. For some people, wandering abroad is even a cure for depression and anxiety. Of course, it's not a foolproof cure, but it might help you feel better, both physically and psychologically.
Traveling more is likely to have a tremendous impact on your mental well-being, especially if you're no used to going out of your comfort zone. Trust me: travel more and your doctor will be happy. Be sure to get in touch with your physician, they might recommend some medication to accompany you in your travels, especially if you're heading to regions of the globe with potentially dangerous diseases.
                    </p>

2. Traveling Lets You Disconnect From Your Daily Life
                    </p>
                    <p>
This is closely related to my previous point. We tend to get so caught up in our daily lives that sometimes, by simply sticking around, we may do ourselves more harm
than good. Your boss is taking over your life? Kids are driving you mad? Your parents are trying to make you live the life they want? How long do you think you can handle this pressure before you burst and everything falls apart?
Sometimes it is best to take a step back, take a deep breath and take go that Tower Bridge selfie. In all seriousness, travel is not a bad option - it is the most natural way of inducing the feeling you miss someone or that you are missed. The trick is to leave with a bit of preparation to avoid making a mistake during your journey. Plus, if you're flying, you better start thinking about booking your tickets sooner than later.

                    <h2>Make Spending Time with Family a Priority</h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                      Do you ever ask yourself why is family important? In our world of pervasive screen time and social media, many of us have actually become less social in the ways that are not only beneficial, but essential to our mental and physical well-being. A Cigna study from the American Journal of Health Promotion indicated that excessive social media use is one of the biggest risk factors for loneliness.
                      We need in-person interactions to reap the full benefits of social connection. Those who experience less loneliness cultivate meaningful relationships, including a social network and a committed relationship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Why is family so important?
                      Family is so important because of all the love and support it provides. Being with family helps construct principles and improves overall mental health. Spending time with family is key to a person’s development as it promotes adaptability and resilience. Such key lessons can only be taught by family members coaching each other regarding life’s ups and downs. Family is what makes us who we are.

                      I’ve got a dog, I’ll take him for a walk,
                      I’ve also got a cat – you can’t really take a cat for a walk
                      but you can just lie on the couch and pet them
                      and that’s quite good for your health, I’ve heard,
                      your mental health, as well as your –
                      it can bring down your blood pressure,
                      I’ve also got a couple of fish so I’ll feed the fish and every once in awhile
                      I have to clean out their tank which is a whole ordeal to get through
                      but since uh… – since I love my fish, I’m willing to do anything for them. "</p>

                      and I’ll typically make something that’ll last me for a few days
                      so it won’t just last me one day.
                      I can cook it, maybe I’ll cook some rice and put in –
                      chop up some veggies – put it in there,
                      maybe a little bit of meat but I’m not a big meat-eater
                      and I’ll cook a big pot of it so that I can put it in some Tupperware
                      and keep it in my fridge or my freezer, store it for even longer,
                      so I can eat it for a while."</p>
